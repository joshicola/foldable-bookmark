# foldable-bookmark
Simple application to create a foldable bookmark from an image

## Usage

```python image_to_pages.py --picture=images/Earth.jpg```

Page_1.svg

## Output

There are two files as output: The Front Side ([Page_1.png](images/Page_1.png)) and the Back Side ([Page_1.png](images/Page_1.png)) (see below).

These can be incorporated into Scalable Vector Graffics files ([Page_1.svg](images/Page_1.svg) and [Page_1.svg](images/Page_1.svg)) and printed directly on either side of a single piece of paper.

Furthermore, they can be combined into a single PDF (see [PDFs](PDFs/)) and printed double-sided.
